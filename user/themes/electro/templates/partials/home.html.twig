#### Amazingly fast and scalable

★ Integrated **PHPFastCGI**-enabled *instant-start* app server, capable of handling thousands of requests per second.

★ It can also run as a conventional and universally compatible PHP application that can be deployed to any hosting provider.

★ It can run your apps either way with absolutely **no code changes**.

★ Accelerate it even more by using the built-in multi-level caching support, PHP's native opcode cache and pre-assembled optimized code loaders.
