# Upgrade Guide

---

## Upgrading from 0.10 to 1.0

> **danger**
> This guide cannot account for all possible configurations and specific features projects may have. So we **cannot guarantee a seamless upgrade** for every project. We can only explain the main concepts of what changed on the framework and what needs to be adjusted on your project.

### Requirements

Electro 1.0 requires PHP 7.2 or higher.

Previous versions required PHP 5.6. If you need to use PHP 5.6, you'll have to stick to a previous version.

### TO DO

This is a stub. The guide will be written when version 1.0 is released.
