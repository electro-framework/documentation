## Managing the installation

### Using the framework's Command Line Interface \(workman\)

Electro comes with a command line interface \(CLI\), called `workman`, that allows you to perform several tasks from the command line.

> The tasks/commands that are available depend on which plugins are installed. Your application may also provide its own commands.

On your project's root directory, type:

```bash
workman
```

You'll get a list of available commands.

Refer to the framework documentation for an explanation of each available command.
