### Modern architecture

* **Elegant and expressive** APIs that take advantage of the latest PHP language features.

* Down to the core plug&amp;play, **fully modular architecture** provides endless flexibility and extensibility.

* **S.O.L.I.D.** design-by-contract, fully **dependency-injected** and **testable** codebase.

* Tries to **avoid anti-patterns**, as much as is reasonable. This means, for example, no singletons, no global "facades" and no service locators.

* Follows modern-day **best-practices**, but still focusing on **easiness** and **convenience** for the developer.

* State of the art **PSR-7/14 compliant**, middleware-based HTTP pipeline and **deep Composer integration** provide easy **bi-directional interoperability** with many libraries and frameworks.

### Fast and scalable

* Optimized startup and fast **hierarchical routing**.

* Built-in multi-level caching support.

### Superior development experience

* Extensively **documented, statically typed** and **refactor-friendly** code.

* **Full autocompletion and code analysis support** for IDEs (works amazingly with PHPStorm).

* Code generators for rapidly **scaffolding** modules, controllers, views, models and many other application components.

* Sophisticated **web debugging console** with enhanced logging and extensive introspection capabilities, makes tracking and solving errors a breeze.

* **Cross-platform**. Additionally, you also get an integrated, easy to setup, lightweight development environment to get you up and running in no time.
