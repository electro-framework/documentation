# Illuminate Database Plugin
Integrates Laravel's Illuminate Database Component into the Electro framework.

### Introdution

If you like Laravel's Eloquent ORM, the Query Builder or the Schema Builder, you can still use them on Electro based projects; just install this plugin for a seamless integration.

This plugin integrates with `PhpKit\ExtPDO` and the framework's database subsystem, so that connections defined on the framework's `Connections` service are automatically available as Illuminate Database connections.
